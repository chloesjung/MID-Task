# Monetary Incentive Delay Task

Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (ABCD study) by National Institute of Health (NIH) is the longitudinal study of brain development and child health. The study examines how the environmental, social, genetic and other biological factors have effects on children's development. Over 10,000 children has been subjected to the study, and the data for this study has been released online.

Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task is a task designed to measure neural activity of incentive receipt anticipation in fMRI. There are three tasks, the control, reward and punishment tasks. Each task is consisted of cue and target (Figure 1). It is known to activate the anticipatory reward processing brain regions, such as Striatum (Knutson et al., 2000 & Loth et al., 2011). 

The fMRI is a blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) imaging, that observes the different areas of brain when active at a given time or during performing some tasks. Although spatial resolution for this method is great, the temporal resolution of this imaging method is not as great. To complement this weakness of this method, we decided to develop a protocol of MID task for an animal model, where we can use intracranial electrode implantation to achieve both excellent spatial and temporal resolution. 

The water-deprived mice were trained of the modified version of MID Task where the water serves as a reward. During the cue phase, the mice are provided with information about whether the task would be control, reward or punishment task. Control task does not provide any water even if they succeed; reward task provide with large amount of water; punishment task provide with less water.  Light and beep with different frequency will alarm the mice of different types of task. If they successfully nose poke (target), they will receive the proper reward/punishment after a anticipatory phase.

This is the raster plot of behavioral data attained from this MID task. Each point indicates nose poke of each mice. The red point indicates the nose pokes that the mice got correctly, thereby receiving the reward. This graph shows how each mice are starting to understand the task, and thereby showing validity to our modified MID task.
